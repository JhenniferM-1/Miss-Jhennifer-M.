\b0  \b SELECT YOUR PRICE ACTION SETUP\b0\par

 \b FORWARD TESTING\b0\par
Having defined backtesting and understood what guides and majes it successful, let me explain what forward testing is as opposed o backtesting.\par
 Forwrd testing is the testing of your strategy using real time price action. This is also known, more commonly, as demo trading. You get to simulate the exact manner in which your money would have been traded in real time without the funding.\par
You can enable forward testing as a tool to build emotional resilience and strength. Real life trading won't be as nerve wracking afer you employ forward testing in your "making certain" tools. This also allows you to tweak anything necessary according to the current market conditions.\par
\par
 If you have gotten this far, you must have understood the in and outs of backtesting, why it is necessary as a fact checking tool, a strategy improver, and why traders use backtesting. Also, the use of forwarrd testing and as what points in your trading journey or prior to taking trades either are necessary.\par
